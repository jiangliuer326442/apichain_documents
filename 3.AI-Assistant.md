The AI functionality currently supports large language models such as GPT-4o, Grok-4, and DeepSeek-Chat, which are highly suitable for programming tasks. After configuring your project’s programming language and development framework, you can ask the AI questions, and it can assist in searching for APIs based on your project’s API list. The AI responds to your queries using this foundational information. This feature is exclusively available to the Team Edition.

## Purchasing an API Key

To use the AI functionality, you must first purchase and configure an API key, which can be used by the entire team. The purchasing process is as follows:

Click the link under Basic Settings > Tokens to open the token purchase popup.

**Token Quantity**：Each interaction with the AI consumes a certain number of tokens, with different models consuming varying amounts. You can purchase an API key that includes a specific number of tokens. Use this API key to access the AI relay server.

All API keys purchased by the team are listed here. You can view the total number of tokens purchased for each key, the remaining token balance (data is cached and requires manual refresh by clicking the refresh button), and which key is currently in use. Click the "Activate" button to set a specific API key as the one currently used by the team.

Additionally, based on the region where your runner is deployed, select a domestic or overseas AI relay node for faster performance.

## Chat

After configuring the programming language and development framework in your project, you can select the project and a language model here to engage in interactive chat with the AI.

## API Search

By selecting the **Search API** option in related operations, the chosen language model will search for APIs based on the current project.
